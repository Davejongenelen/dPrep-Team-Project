## Motivation

## Composition

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
load("data_cleaned.RData" )
#load("./gen/paper/input/data_cleaned.RData")
#tinytex::install_tinytex()

library(ggplot2)
```

First of all, a summary of the data set that is used will be provided. This data set has been cleaned from errors, NA's and abundant data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
reduced_df_cleaned <- df_cleaned[,c(3:7, 9:12)]
summary(reduced_df_cleaned)
avg_prices_df <- df_cleaned %>% group_by(host_is_superhost) %>% summarise(avg_price=mean(price_numeric))
ggplot(avg_prices_df, aes(x=host_is_superhost, y=avg_price))+geom_col()

```
The barplot above shows that super hosts have on average lower prices.


Underneath are some summary statistics about the variables used in this study.
```{r }
summary(df_cleaned$price_numeric)
summary(df_cleaned$host_is_superhost_binary)


```
