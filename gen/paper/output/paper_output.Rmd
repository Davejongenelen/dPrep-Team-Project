###Motivation

###Composition

```{r }

load("df_cleaned.csv")

```
First of all, a summary of the dataset that is used will be provided. This dataset has been cleaned from errors, NA's and abundant data.
```{r }
reduced_df_cleaned <- df_cleaned[,c(3:7, 9:12)]
summary(reduced_df_cleaned)
mean_price <- mean(df_cleaned$price_numeric)
mean_price
ggplot(df_cleaned, aes(x= host_is_superhost, y = mean_price))+geom_col()

avg_prices_df <- df_cleaned %>% group_by(host_is_superhost) %>% summarise(avg_price=mean(price_numeric))

ggplot(avg_prices_df, aes(x=host_is_superhost, y=avg_price))+geom_col()

```
The barplot above shows that super hosts have on average lower prices.


Underneath are some summary statistics about the variables used in this study.
```{r }
summary(df_cleaned$price_numeric)
summary(df_cleaned$host_is_superhost_binary)


```
