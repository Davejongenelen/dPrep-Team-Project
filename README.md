__Research Question__

## Motivation

Motivate your research question or business problem. Clearly explain which problem is solved. Tip given in tutorial: Write as though if you work for Airbnb

## Data
The team project draws on datasets from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) which is an independent open-source data tool developed by community activist Murray Cox who aims to shed light on how [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) is being used and affecting neighborhoods in large cities. The tool provides a visual overview of the amount, availability, and spread of rooms across a city, as well as an approximation of the number of bookings and occupancy rate.
