This file provides users of the data set with the main findings of the research that has been done. The first part is about the structure of the data set, then some assumptions are tested. After that comes the analysis, which consists of two parts: the first part concludes that there is a significant difference in prices of super hosts and non-super hosts. The second part of the analysis results in the significant difference in prices when considering price classes. Hereby, the results show that the classes > $ 100 to $ 150 and > $ 250 see significant differences in prices between super hosts and non-super hosts.
